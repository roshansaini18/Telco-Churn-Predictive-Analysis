## üßπ Data Preprocessing

```python
# Importing Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Reading Dataset
df = pd.read_csv("Customer Churn.csv")

# Handling missing or blank TotalCharges
df["TotalCharges"] = df["TotalCharges"].replace(" ", "0").astype("float")

# Converting 'SeniorCitizen' from numeric to categorical
def conv(value):
    return "yes" if value == 1 else "no"
df['SeniorCitizen'] = df["SeniorCitizen"].apply(conv)

# Checking data info
df.info()

# Checking for missing values
df.isnull().sum()
